# Effective Modern Cpp

I was an official reviewer for Scott Meyer his "Effective Modern C++" book.  I
have reviewed a large part of the book (not completely).  That means I accepted
draft book material, reviewed the text, tested the code, and sent Scott
comments and questions.  In addition to testing almost all the code examples, I
offered insights into the readability and comprehensibility of the descriptive
material, and pointed out places where non-native English speakers (a
significant part of the readership) might be confused or be unfamiliar with the
vocabulary Scott had chosen.

This repository contains my sample code for the book.  It is not officially
linked to the book or Scott.  It contains my own version of the sample code.
My goal was to provide the C++ community with something that can be used in a
hands-on way to play with the concepts explained in the book.

Feel free to send me comments and questions, or to take a look at the TODO-list
and send me pull-requests.

Oh, and by the way, I'm a single father of a 5-year-old son looking for a
remote C++ job (as a regular employee, not as a freelancer).  If you think you
can use my skills, go see my LinkedIn profile at
