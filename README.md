# Effective Modern C++

I was an official reviewer for Scott Meyer his "Effective Modern C++" book.  I
have reviewed a large part of it (not all 42 items though).  I accepted draft
book material, reviewed the text, tested the code, and sent Scott comments and
questions.  In addition to testing almost all the code examples, I offered
insights into the readability and comprehensibility of the descriptive material,
and pointed out places where non-native English speakers (a significant part of
the readership) might be confused or be unfamiliar with the vocabulary Scott had
chosen.

This repository contains my compilable implementation for the code in the book.
It is not officially linked to the book nor to Scott.  It contains my personal,
practical hands-on implementation of the sample code.  My goal is to provide
the C++ community with something that can be used in a hands-on way to play with
the concepts explained in the book.  Feel free to send me comments and
questions, or to take a look at the TODO-list and send me pull-requests.

Oh, and by the way, I'm a single father of a 5-year-old son.  Finding a
software-engineering job with a good work-life balance is not easy with this
constraint.  I'm therefore looking for a remote C++ job (as a regular employee,
not as a freelancer).  If you think you can use my skills, go see my LinkedIn
profile at http://be.linkedin.com/in/BartVandewoestyne and send me a message!
